# shoppingCart

This was a project I worked on for my CS 80: Computer Programming class.
I worked with two other teammates.
We created a fake t-shirt company and made an online shopping cart.
The goal was to make it simple, aesthetically pleasing, and functional.
The biggest lessons I learned was

        1. Understanding how complicated a large scale shopping can be
        2. The importance of teamwork
